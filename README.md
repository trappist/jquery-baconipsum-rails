# jQuery Bacon Ipsum for Rails

[jQuery-Bacon-Ipsum](https://github.com/petenelson/bacon-ipsum) is the BaconIpsumGenerator class for generating meaty filler text, via the [BaconIpsum](http://baconipsum.com/) API

This is the plugin for the Rails 4 asset pipeline. Should also work with Rails 3.2 but not tested.
